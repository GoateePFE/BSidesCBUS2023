# Secure Your Career with a Personal Brand

## Abstract
You're applying for a new job. You really want it. There are five candidates. What is the one thing you can do that will give you a brilliant advantage over the other applicants?
I have taught many technical skills over the years. But there is one skill I have not had the opportunity to teach yetâ€¦ personal brand. This skill is arguably more important than any one passing tech trend that could be delivered in a breakout session. It is a timeless skill that will pay dividends for the remainder of your career.
* Learn how to impact people around the world, far beyond the borders of your home office and your IT team.
* Learn how to build a calling card that will open doors for your career, provide personal satisfaction, and provide for yourself and your family for years to come.
* Learn how to give back to the technical community that has propelled your own career growth.
* Learn how to build a personal brand from someone who has been there, done that, got the t-shirts, got the lanyards, got the clicks, got the goatee.
